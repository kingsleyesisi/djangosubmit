## Deployment üöÄ

1.  **Collect static files**
    ```bash
    python manage.py collectstatic
    ```

2.  **Configure WSGI server**
    - Ensure your WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI) is properly configured to serve the Django application.

    Example using Gunicorn:

    ```bash
    gunicorn sales_management.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
    ```

3.  **Set up a reverse proxy**
    - Use a reverse proxy server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to handle incoming requests and forward them to the WSGI server.
    - Configure the reverse proxy to serve static files.

4.  **Database Configuration**
    - For production environments, consider using a more robust database system like PostgreSQL instead of SQLite.
    - Update the `DATABASES` setting in `settings.py` accordingly.
